# Cut a release: bump the plugin version, rebuild the TypeScript bundle from
# source, commit the freshly-built artifacts into wiki-plugin/scripts/, and
# assemble the OpenCode npm package (wiki-plugin/opencode-npm/) so a
# marketplace install and `npm publish` ship the same build.
#
# Usage:  scripts/release.sh <new-version>
#   e.g.  scripts/release.sh 0.10.0
#
# Version coupling: plugin.json is the single source of truth for the version.
# This script bumps plugin.json; assemble-opencode-package.py then reads it and
# writes the version into wiki-plugin/opencode-npm/package.json, so one bump
# drives both artifacts. `npm publish` runs automatically in tag-release.yml
# after merge via npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC) — no NPM_TOKEN secret.
#
# Must be run from the repo root, on a worktree/PR branch (never main, which
# is protected). Commits the version bump plus the regenerated artifacts, then
# pushes to the current branch's remote so a PR can be opened/updated. The
# freshness guard in ts-enchiridion.yml then independently re-verifies on the
# PR that the committed bundle equals a fresh build.
#
# Do NOT manually tag or run `gh release create`: tag-release.yml derives the
# tag from plugin.json on merge to main and creates the GitHub Release from it
# in the same workflow — a separate release.yml was inlined because a
# fine-grained PAT cannot trigger a downstream on:push workflow.
