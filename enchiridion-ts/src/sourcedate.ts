/**
 * sourcedate — the one owner of the source-date rule.
 *
 * A page's `source_date` is valid time and has exactly one canonical spelling,
 * [CANONICAL_DATE_FORMAT] (#192). That rule — which spellings count, and how a
 * clock truncates to its date — once lived in four private implementations
 * that drifted: `page set` accepted an invalid calendar date that ingest
 * refused, and the search index validated nothing at all (#309). This module
 * is the rule, implemented once — and applied at one place, the frontmatter
 * writer, rather than by each caller that builds a page (#499).
 *
 * [parseSourceDate] is the single shared fact: parse any accepted spelling,
 * validate the calendar date (leap years, month/day ranges), and return the
 * canonical [CANONICAL_DATE_FORMAT], or null when the value isn't a valid
 * date. The two postures on top of it — [canonicalSourceDate] refuses (throws
 * on a non-date), [truncateSourceDate] tolerates (passes the value through) —
 * split *validating* from *writing*, not one caller from another:
 *
 *   - The **writer** tolerates. Frontmatter bytes are produced in exactly one
 *     place — [wikipage.Page.set], which [wikipage.Page.merge] also goes
 *     through — so the rule is applied there and no caller can forget it:
 *     whatever spelling a value arrives in, the page that reaches disk
 *     carries the canonical one. A non-date passes through that writer
 *     untouched; a writer must never throw on content it was handed.
 *   - **Validation** refuses, and stays with the callers that validate before
 *     they write: `page set` refuses a non-date argument up front, and
 *     ingest's pre-flight refuses it in the plan. That is what turns a bad
 *     `source_date` into a message instead of a silently stored value.
 *
 * The read path (pagerecord) tolerates in the writer's way, storing the value
 * verbatim — it renders its own fallback from [parseSourceDate], not via
 * [truncateSourceDate].
