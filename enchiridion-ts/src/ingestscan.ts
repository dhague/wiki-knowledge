/**
 * The ingestion sweep — scan `raw/` for files that need ingestion.
 *
 * Two independent gates: derived done-state (computed here) and declared
 * policy (a human-authored `.ingestignore`). A raw file is *offered* when
 * (a) no wiki page's `raw_source` points at it, or (b) one does but the raw
 * file is strictly newer than that page's `git_date`, or `git status
 * --porcelain` reports it dirty.
 *
 * `.ingestignore` is read from the file's own folder only, with **no ancestor
 * walk** — the same rule `INGESTION.md` follows, and what keeps a
 * hand-written policy file from drifting into a machine-written done-list.
 * The parse/append halves live in [ingestignore], shared with `ingest
 * --ignore`.
