/**
 * The one definition of what counts as a page (#310).
 *
 * "What is a page" used to be computed three different ways — the disk walk
 * (formerly `vault.pageRefs`, now this module's `enumeratePageRefs`), the
 * committed-history walk (`vaultgit`), and the search index's on-disk status
 * count — and the answers diverged on edge
 * vaults: a committed `wiki/_index.md` counted for the git walk but not the
 * disk walk, and a nested `wiki/<folder>/nested/deep.md` counted for the disk
 * walk, was rejected by the schema reader (`pagerecord`), and was missed by
 * the status count. The generated-index bug (#299) was that friction
 * surfacing.
 *
 * This module is the single predicate and the single disk enumerator that
 * both walks and the status count delegate to, so the three can never
 * disagree again. It is deliberately a leaf module — it imports nothing from
 * the rest of the codebase — which is exactly why `searchindex` can use it
 * without the import cycle that proxying back through `vault` would create
 * (the Vault has no search-index facade; ADR-0015).
 *
 * **The page rule:** a page is a markdown file at exactly
 * `wiki/<kind-folder>/<file>.md` — directly under a kind-folder, the same
 * shape `pagerecord.newPageRecord` requires — and never the generated
 * `wiki/_index.md`. Anything else under `wiki/` (a file at the wiki root, a
 * nested page, the generated index) is a structural error, not a page, so it
 * is neither enumerated, indexed, nor counted. The kind-folder axis itself is
 * ADR-0008's (folders pluralize, values stay singular); this predicate is
 * purely structural about it — the folder is one path segment — and says
 * nothing about which folder names are canonical, so custom kind-folders
 * (`wiki/decisions/`) are pages too, exactly as `pagerecord` accepts them.

/** `KIND.md` placed inside a kind-folder (`wiki/<kind>/KIND.md`) is metadata

/**
 * The page predicate: whether a vault-relative path (ADR-0009) names a page.
 *
 * A page is `wiki/<kind-folder>/<file>.md` — exactly three path segments, a
 * `.md` suffix, and never the generated index or a `KIND.md` kind-metadata
 * file. Every consumer of the page concept — the disk walk
 * (`enumeratePageRefs`), the git walk (`vaultgit.committedPages`), and the
 * index's status count — filters through this one predicate, so no two of them
 * can disagree about an edge vault.
 *
 * Excluded by the shape: `wiki/a.md` (no kind-folder), `wiki/_index.md` (not
 * directly under a kind-folder — and never a page on principle),
 * `wiki/concepts/nested/deep.md` (not *directly* under a kind-folder), and
 * anything outside `wiki/`. Nested pages are a structural error under the
 * kind-folder model (ADR-0008), the same stance the schema reader takes, so
 * they are not pages.
