/**
 * commit — write one structured git commit per ingestion/edit.
 *
 * The commit message is a compounding asset — audit log, "what changed this
 * week" feed, manager-report source — so it is emitted here, never freehand
 * by the agent. This doc comment is the format's only specification:
 *
 *	ingest: <source doc title>
 *
 *	created: wiki/concepts/prepared-statements.md
 *	updated: wiki/concepts/db-connection-pooling.md
 *	superseded: wiki/sources/deploy-capistrano.md -> wiki/sources/deploy-github-actions.md
 *	source-date: 2026-03-01
 *
 * Git is a **hard dependency**: a root that isn't a work tree is an error,
 * never a silent skip — the time model depends on the history being
 * complete.
 *
 * A manifest naming a RawSource is additionally gated on
 * [checkChainOfEvidence], failing before anything is staged. This is the
 * hard block; the ingest package runs the same check earlier, at
 * plan-validation time, as a courtesy to the agent.
