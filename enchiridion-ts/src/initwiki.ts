/**
 * Scaffolds a brand-new, empty wiki vault — folders, git repo, .gitignore,
 * and (for query-from-anywhere mode) the plugin-registration settings.json —
 * or seeds a repo around a directory that already carries a `wiki/` tree but
 * no git work tree, the conversion path a Joule user lands on (#323).
 *
 * One-time setup, distinct from `wiki-ingest`, which fills a vault that
 * already exists — [init] refuses to run against a directory that is already
 * a vault ([isVault]: a marker **and** a git work tree). A marker without
 * git still resolves as a vault root for reads ([vault.resolveRoot]'s walk
 * is untouched), but it isn't a seedable-away vault; [init] proceeds over
 * the existing tree, git-inits around it, and the initial commit sweeps the
 * existing pages in.
 *
 * Deployment mode (ADR-0004) is the caller's judgment call, never inferred
 * here: [ModeQueryFromAnywhere] writes `.claude/settings.json` registering
 * pluginRoot as a local-directory marketplace; [ModeDedicated] skips that
 * write, since installing a plugin project-scope into someone else's
 * directory isn't this module's job.
