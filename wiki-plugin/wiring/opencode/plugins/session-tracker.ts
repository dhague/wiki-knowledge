/** Session-tracker plugin for OpenCode: records every session_id as it is
 * created so /save-conversation can find the current session without guessing.
 *
 * Mirrors the Claude Code `SessionStart` hook (`enchiridion hook session-start`):
 * state is one JSON file per session_id under the project's own
 * `.opencode/wiki-knowledge/sessions/` (gitignored), so parallel sessions
 * sharing a project don't clobber each other. OpenCode keeps transcripts in
 * its database rather than on disk, so this plugin records only the
 * session_id — the transcript is fetched at save time via
 * `opencode export <session_id>`.
 *
 * OpenCode records no session id in the environment of processes it spawns,
 * so a reader would have no way to know which session is current. This plugin
 * therefore also hooks `shell.env` — every shell command OpenCode runs
 * receives `$OPENCODE_SESSION_ID` — giving the reader the exact analog of
 * Claude Code's `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`.
 *
 * The reader is `enchiridion save-session` (#188): it detects the host from
 * which session-id variable is set, validates the id against the state this
 * plugin writes, and fetches the transcript with `opencode export`.
 *
 * Events are already scoped to the plugin's directory (OpenCode drops events
 * whose `location.directory` differs), but the session's own directory is
 * preferred anyway so state lands in the project the session actually
 * belongs to — the same preference the CC hook now states outright, resolving
 * the project rather than wherever a tool last ran (#485).
 *
 * Never raises or blocks: any failure is swallowed so a broken tracker can't
 * interrupt session start.
