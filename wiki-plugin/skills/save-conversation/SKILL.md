# Save Conversation

Captures session transcript into `$WIKI_ROOT/raw/conversations/`, files it into wiki.

**On Claude Code**, resolve the binary once before any step that calls it:
```bash
ENCHIRIDION=$(ls ~/.claude/plugins/cache/enchiridion-wiki-plugin/wiki-knowledge/*/bin/enchiridion | sort -V | tail -1)
```
Use `"$ENCHIRIDION"` for every call below. **On OpenCode** replace every `Bash` + `"$ENCHIRIDION" <subcommand> <args...>` call with `wiki(args=["<subcommand>", ...])` — same subcommand, same flags, no path to resolve. See `## Scripts` in `wiki-conventions` for detail.

## Procedure

`save-session` detects the host from which session-id var is set — `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` or `$OPENCODE_SESSION_ID` — and fetches transcript accordingly.

1. Run capture script with `WIKI_ROOT` set to target vault (per deployment-mode resolution — script runs outside vault, can't use marker-directory discovery from cwd):
   ```
   WIKI_ROOT="<path to vault>" "$ENCHIRIDION" save-session --slug "<short phrase>"
   ```
   `--slug`: short phrase naming what session **covered**, judged from whole conversation — not how it opened. Session that started "look at issue 33" and became filename design argument is `wayfinder-33-raw-filename-slugs`, not `look-at-issue-33`. Few words right; script caps it.
   - Script **sanitizes rather than trusts** phrase (lowercased, `[^a-z0-9]+` → `-`, capped) — printed path differs from what you passed. Read path from stdout; never reconstruct from phrase.
   - Name **bound at first save**. Re-save reuses existing file, rewrites in place, ignores new `--slug` — raw files never renamed. Session changed topic: start new session, don't rename.

   Looks up session transcript per host: Claude Code by `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, using path `SessionStart` hook (`enchiridion hook session-start`) recorded at session start; OpenCode by `$OPENCODE_SESSION_ID` (injected by session-tracker plugin), fetched via `opencode export`. Writes markdown transcript to vault's `raw/conversations/` inbox, prints vault-relative path (e.g. `raw/conversations/2026-07-28-1430-charting-wayfinder-33-1dc3e094.md`).
   - Non-zero exit (nothing to save, no transcript recorded, not enough conversation): report and stop.
2. Ingest file just written: delegate to `wiki-ingest` agent (`Task` with `subagent_type: "wiki-ingest"`) with prompt `Ingest <path> into the vault.`, using exact path from step 1.
3. Relay ingest manifest (pages created/updated) to user.
